/**
 * Module: `@features/governance/hooks/useAuthorizePublishing`
 * Purpose: Owner-wallet state machine for the ONE-TIME, SCOPED "Authorize publishing" step of node
 *   distribution setup. It grants the owner's wallet standing (but scoped) authority to publish THIS
 *   node's distributions — and nothing else — so every subsequent per-epoch publish is a single direct
 *   `DAO.execute` with NO vote. Two wallet transactions:
 *     1. DEPLOY `DistributionPublishCondition(token, distributor)` — a tiny per-node permission
 *        condition whose `isGranted` returns true ONLY for the exact publish action set. Capture its
 *        address from the deploy receipt.
 *     2. GOVERNANCE PROPOSAL: `plugin.createProposal([DAO.grantWithCondition(DAO, wallet,
 *        EXECUTE_PERMISSION, condition)], 0, 0, 0, Yes, tryEarlyExecution)`. On a 100%-owner
 *        EarlyExecution DAO this auto-executes, giving the wallet the SCOPED standing grant. This IS
 *        a governance proposal — honest, and labeled as such by the caller; never an unconditional
 *        EXECUTE grant (even a compromised executor key can only publish, never drain the treasury).
 * Scope: Client-side wagmi wiring shared by BOTH the per-epoch publish panel and the node distribution
 *   setup sequence so both drive the same authorize flow. Reads no secrets; the connected wallet signs
 *   every transaction. Does NOT read `hasPermission` — the caller reads it (via `useHasExecutePermission`)
 *   to gate/skip this step and re-reads when this hook reports success.
 * Invariants:
 *   - AUTHORIZE_IS_A_PROPOSAL: the grant is wrapped in createProposal(Yes, tryEarlyExecution); it is a
 *     governance action, never "executed".
 *   - SCOPED_GRANT: always `grantWithCondition` bound to the deployed condition — never a bare `grant`.
 *   - WALLET_SIGNS: deploy + proposal are both signed by the connected wallet, never the operator.
 *   - ADDRESSES_ONLY: no token math — every value is an address/hash/bytes.
 * Side-effects: blockchain writes (condition deploy tx; createProposal-with-grant tx).
 * Links: src/features/governance/lib/proposal-abis.ts,
